RH strain tachyzoites were resuspended in diluted Matrigel containing Hoechst 33342.
Fluorescent parasite nuclei were imaged in a 402 um x 401 um x 40 um volume 
(1 um z-slices) every 0.88 s for 60 s by time-lapse fluorescence videomicroscopy.
The parasites move in left-handed, corkscrew-like trajectories; one representative
trajectory is highlighted in green. Video playback is set at 4.5x speed. 
Scale bar = 10 um.
