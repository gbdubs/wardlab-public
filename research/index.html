<p><strong>Nearly one third of the world’s population is infected with <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em></strong>.
Although most infections are asymptomatic, toxoplasmosis can be life-threatening during
pregnancy and in people with immune systems weakened by immunosuppressants or AIDS.
<em>T. gondii</em> can only multiply within cells of its host, and repeated cycles of host
cell invasion, parasite multiplication and host cell lysis are a major cause of the
tissue damage that occurs during acute infection. A better understanding of the
mechanisms of host cell invasion by <em>T. gondii</em> is therefore important to the
development of new approaches to treating toxoplasmosis. <em>T. gondii</em> is also a powerful
model for studying the invasion of related apicomplexan parasites, including those that
cause malaria  and cryptosporidiosis.</p>

<p><strong>A major focus of our research</strong> is to identify <em>T. gondii</em> proteins that play a role in
invasion and to determine exactly what these proteins do. We are studying the function
of one protein, AMA1, in detail, and we have developed more general, small-molecule-based
approaches to identifying new invasion-related proteins. The small molecule work has also
led us to study the molecular mechanisms underlying <strong>parasite motility</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ama1-proteins">AMA1 Proteins</h2>

<p>AMA1 proteins secreted onto the parasite surface from apical organelles, the micronemes,
are thought to play an important role in invasion. One highly conserved microneme
protein that has received much attention as a malaria vaccine candidate is apical
membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). AMA1 is a type I transmembrane protein with a large
extracellular domain and a short cytosolic tail. AMA1 directly mediates the physical
interaction between the parasite and host cell: remarkably, the extracellular domain
of AMA1 on the parasite surface binds to a receptor on the host cell (RON2) that is
inserted into the host cell membrane by the invading parasite. We are currently studying
two aspects of <em>T. gondii</em> AMA1 critical to its role in mediating invasion: (a) the
function of its cytosolic tail and (b) why and how its extracellular domain is cleaved
and shed from the parasite surface during invasion.</p>

<h2 id="small-molecule-based-approaches">Small-molecule-based approaches</h2>

<p>One approach we are taking to identify new invasion-related proteins is to screen
large collections of small molecules for compounds that inhibit invasion and then
determine how these compounds exert their effects. The screening part of this project
has yielded a set of small molecules that affect invasion in a variety of interesting
ways; the challenge now is to identify their targets within the parasite.
We have developed specific biochemical and genetic strategies for target identification, and we have gained new insights into invasion in the process. We are currently using these methods to understand how the compounds of most interest from our screens and from the screens of others perturb host cell inavsion.
In addition to providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying invasion, this
work has clear drug development implications for <em>T. gondii</em> and other apicomplexan
parasites. This project is being done in close collaboration with Dr. Nick Westwood
at the University of St. Andrews.</p>

<h2 id="motility">Motility</h2>

<p>Parasite motility is important for parasite movement into and out of host cells,
for crossing biological barriers and for dissemination through the body during
infection. Parasite motility is therefore essential for virulence and pathogenesis.
Proteins of the parasite’s motility apparatus, including the myosin motor protein,
MyoA, are highly conserved across apicomplexan parasites but absent or divergent in
higher eukaryotes, suggesting that they may be useful drug targets. Intriguingly,
over 90% of the invasion inhibitors identified in our small molecule screens affect
parasite motility. We have shown that one of the compounds we identified by
high-throughput screening (tachypleginA) inhibits motility by covalently modifying
myosin light chain, a protein that directly regulates MyoA activity. Using tachypleginA
and other motility-inhibiting compounds as chemical probes, together with parasites
containing mutations in proteins of the motility apparatus and a variety of assays
we have developed to study motor function such as our recently described 3D motility
assay, we are attempting to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of how
<em>T. gondii</em> and related parasites move between and into cells of their hosts
during infection.</p>
